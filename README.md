Pagination and Sorting App Documentation
Introduction
The Pagination and Sorting App is a backend application developed using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and PostgreSQL. It provides efficient pagination and sorting functionalities for managing large datasets. This documentation outlines the features and usage of the application.

Features
Pagination: Efficiently retrieve subsets of data by dividing large datasets into smaller, manageable pages.
Sorting: Sort data based on specified criteria to facilitate easier navigation and analysis.
Spring Boot Integration: Utilize the Spring Boot framework for streamlined development and deployment.
Spring Data JPA: Leverage Spring Data JPA for simplified data access and persistence.
PostgreSQL Database: Store and manage data using PostgreSQL, a powerful open-source relational database management system.
Technologies Used
Java 19: Programming language used for backend logic.
Spring Boot: Framework used for building and deploying Java-based applications.
Spring Data JPA: Part of the Spring Data project, provides support for JPA-based data access.
PostgreSQL: Relational database management system used for data storage.
JSON: Lightweight data interchange format used for data exchange between client and server.
Usage
1. Pagination
Users can specify the page number and size to retrieve a specific subset of data.
The application returns paginated results, ensuring efficient handling of large datasets.
2. Sorting
Users can specify sorting criteria such as field name and sort order (ascending or descending).
The application sorts the data based on the specified criteria before returning the results.
3. Integration with PostgreSQL Database
The application seamlessly integrates with a PostgreSQL database for data storage and retrieval.
Data access operations are performed using Spring Data JPA, providing a simplified and standardized approach to data access.
Implementation Details
The application is implemented using the following steps:

Spring Boot Application Setup: Set up a Spring Boot project and configure dependencies.
Database Configuration: Configure connection properties for connecting to the PostgreSQL database.
Entity and Repository Setup: Define entity classes to represent data entities and corresponding repositories for data access operations.
Pagination and Sorting Logic: Implement pagination and sorting logic using Spring Data JPA query methods or specifications.
Controller and Service Layers: Implement controller and service layers to handle incoming requests, process data, and return responses.
Testing and Deployment: Thoroughly test the application to ensure its functionality and deploy it to a production environment.
Conclusion
The Pagination and Sorting App offers efficient pagination and sorting functionalities for managing large datasets. By following the guidelines provided in this documentation, users can effectively utilize the application to retrieve and analyze data with ease.
